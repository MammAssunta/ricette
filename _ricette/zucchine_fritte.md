# Ingredients (serves 2-3)

## (the quantity of the ingredients depends on the size of the courgette and the egg; please, use your judgement, the batter should run off the whisk/fork but not be liquid)
- 1 medium courgette
- 1 medium egg
- 1/4 cup of flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt 
- Water if needed (if you have fizzy water use it, otherwise nirmal water is good)
- Frying oil (could be sunflower, vegetable or any seed you prefer or are available)

# Method
1. With a knife, gently scrape the lenght of the courgette. (Some green will come off and that is ok, but you do not want to completely peel it.)
1. Wash the courgette.
1. Thinly slice the courgette in round shapes. 
1. In a bowl, whisk egg, then add salt and flour. 
1. Keep whisking until you get a soft and smooth constistency.
1. If the batter is too thick, gradually add water, whisking until the batter slides off the whisk but its not too liquid. If instead, the batter is too liquid, add a bit more flour, a small quantity at a time..
1. In a pan, pour enough oil to cover the base so that the courgette pieces will be almost completely covered. (while you fry them, you can add oil if needed)
1. When the oil is hot (medium-high temperature), dip the courgettes in the batter, a few at a time, then pick them up individually and lay the in the pan.
1. Let them cook on one side until golden (around a couple of minutes) then turn them over.
1. When they are golden on both side, pick them up (if you have one of those spoons/ladels with holes for drainage even better) and drain them in a plate covered with kitchen towel for absorbing the excess oil.
1. When they are ll on the plate, sprinkle a bit of salt and enjoy!
