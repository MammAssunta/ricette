name: Rice salad

## Ingredients (serves 2-3)

### (these ingredients are basic, they can be removed if not of taste and others can be added if preferred, such as diced fresh peppers, celery, diced carrots)

200g rice

1 tin of tuna in oil

pitted olives (black, green or a bit of both)

50g peas (easier if tinned)

50g sweetcorn (easier if tinned)

50g prosciutto cotto in cubes

50g hard cheese in cubes

2-3 diced pickles

2 salad tomatoes, deseeded and cut in cubes

Salt to taste

2 boiled eggs (optional)



## Method

Cook rice according to instructions on the packet. 

Drain it just a bit 'al dente' so it doesn't become mushy and rinse it under cold water. Leave it on one side.

While the rice cooks, if you'd like to use the eggs, boil them then let them sit in cold water to cool down before peeling them.

If using frozen peas and sweetcorn, cook them according to packet's instructions; if tinned, drain.

In the meantime, dice all the vegetables, meat, cheese and olives.

In a bowl, mix rice and diced ingredients.

Open the tuna and discard a little oil (do not drain it all because it is your salad dressing). Mix it in the salad. (Note: If fusing tuna in brine or water, drain well and then use oil (olive or vegetable/sunflower) to dress the salad.)

Add salt to taste.

If using boiled eggs, slice them and add them to the salad, once you serve it.
